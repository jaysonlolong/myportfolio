This project is my very first portfolio website to be published. Here's a breakdown of what I have:

1. **Navigation Bar**: It's a Bootstrap navbar that collapses on smaller screens. It includes links to various sections of portfolio, such as Home, Projects, Work Experience, About, Contact, and Credits.

2. **Sections**: Each section represents a different part of portfolio. Currently, only the "Home", "Work Experience", "About Me", "Contact Me", and "Credits" sections are implemented. The "Projects" section is empty and needs to be filled with project items.

3. **JavaScript Function**: I have a JavaScript function called `showSection(sectionId)` that takes a section ID as an argument and shows the corresponding section while hiding the others. This function is called when clicking on any navigation link.

Additionally, here's a breakdown of the styles I've applied:

1. **General Section Styles**:
   - `.section`: Applies padding, text alignment, and sets the text color to white.
   - `.section h2`: Adds margin below the heading elements within sections.

2. **Fixed Navigation Bar Styles**:
   - `.fixed-top`: Positions the navigation bar fixed at the top of the viewport, making it sticky. It spans the full width of the viewport and has a high z-index to ensure it appears above other elements.

3. **Background Image Styles**:
   - `body, .navbar`: Sets the background color to transparent and applies a background image using a data URI encoded SVG. This creates a decorative background effect for the entire page and the navigation bar.
     - The SVG used is a pattern consisting of multiple colored layers, providing a visually appealing background effect.

These styles contribute to the overall visual presentation and layout of portfolio website. They ensure consistent spacing, color scheme, and a fixed navigation bar for easy navigation throughout the site. Additionally, the background image adds visual interest to the page.

To complete the project, I'll need to:

- Populate the "Projects" section with information about my projects.
- Implement a contact form in the "Contact Me" section.
- Style your website using the `styles.css` file referenced in HTML.
- Add content and possibly additional sections as needed to fully showcase my skills and experience.

If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with any part of my project, feel free to ask!
