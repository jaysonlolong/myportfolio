This project is my very first portfolio website to be published. Here's a breakdown of what I have:

1. **Navigation Bar**: It's a Bootstrap navbar that collapses on smaller screens. It includes links to various sections of portfolio, such as Home, Projects, Work Experience, About, Contact, and Credits.

2. **Sections**: Each section represents a different part of portfolio. Currently, only the "Home", "Work Experience", "About Me", "Contact Me", and "Credits" sections are implemented. The "Projects" section is empty and needs to be filled with project items.

3. **JavaScript Function**: I have a JavaScript function called `showSection(sectionId)` that takes a section ID as an argument and shows the corresponding section while hiding the others. This function is called when clicking on any navigation link.

To complete the project, I'll need to:

- Populate the "Projects" section with information about my projects.
- Implement a contact form in the "Contact Me" section.
- Style your website using the `styles.css` file referenced in HTML.
- Add content and possibly additional sections as needed to fully showcase my skills and experience.

If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with any part of my project, feel free to ask!
